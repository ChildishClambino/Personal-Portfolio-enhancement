This website is my new and improved personal portfolio!
The first update that I made whas changing the whole color scheme. Previously I had a picture as the background. In order to make my webpage look more professional I instead used different colored background and styling it.
The other big update is that my profrile picture is now animated with a bit of a twist zoom effect. 
I made the contact page a styled form. The look I was going for was a more modern forms page that you might see on someones personal website.
I do not have social media but I included a spot where someone could put their social media profiles.
